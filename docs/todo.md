next steps to replicating Dune
- [x] fix the rendering error (not mtching the server) - it was the table not having tbody and thead and also dynamic rendering of the charts
- [x] show both the address and value on the pie chart
- [ ] check that the ABI is right for the logs - only logs emitted by the transaction itself
- [ ] make the data fetch client side so that it's ok on fleek - ipfs wouldn't accept such large files on this page
- [ ] show stuff other than weth
- [ ] make the import dynamic for the chart for the trader
